    "abstract": "Ad creatives are ads served to users on a webpage, app, or other digital environments. The demand for compelling ad creatives surges drastically with the ever-increasing popularity of digital marketing. The two most essential elements of (display) ad creatives are the advertising message, such as headlines and description texts, and the visual component, such as images and videos. Traditionally, ad creatives are composed by professional copywriters and creative designers. The process requires significant human effort, limiting the scalability and efficiency of digital ad campaigns. This work introduces AUTOCREATIVE, a novel system to automatically generate ad creatives relying on natural language generation and computer vision techniques. The system generates multiple ad copies (ad headlines/description texts) using a sequence-to-sequence model and selects images most suitable to the generated ad copies based on heuristic-based visual appeal metrics and a text-image retrieval pipeline.",

    "abstract": "For autonomous agents such as robots to effectively communicate with humans, they must be able to refer to different entities in situated contexts. In service of this goal, researchers have recently attempted to model the selection of referring forms on the basis of cognitive status (informed by Givenness Hierarchy), and have shown promising results with over 80% accuracy. However, we argue that the task environments lack ecological validity, due to their use of a small number of objects that are constantly activated and easily uniquely identifiable. Accordingly, we present a novel buildingconstruction task that we believe has increased ecological validity. We then show how training cognitive status informed referring form selection models on data collected within this novel task environment yields substantially different results from those found in previous work, providing key insights and directions for future work.",

    "abstract": "The recent advances in transfer learning techniques and pre-training of large contextualized encoders foster innovation in real-life applications, including dialog assistants. Practical needs of intent recognition require effective data usage and the ability to constantly update supported intents, adopting new ones, and abandoning outdated ones. In particular, the generalized zero-shot paradigm, in which the model is trained on the seen intents and tested on both seen and unseen intents, is taking on new importance. In this paper, we explore the generalized zero-shot setup for intent recognition. Following best practices for zero-shot text classification, we treat the task with a sentence pair modeling approach. We outperform previous state-of-the-art f1-measure by up to 16% for unseen intents, using intent labels and user utterances and without accessing external sources (such as knowledge bases). Further enhancement includes lexicalization of intent labels, which improves performance by up to 7%. By using task transferring from other sentence pair tasks, such as Natural Language Inference, we gain additional improvements.",

    "session": "Oral Session 3",
    "abstract": "Text style transfer aims to change the style (e.g., sentiment, politeness) of a sentence while preserving its content. A common solution is the prototype editing approach, where stylistic tokens are deleted in the “mask” stage and then the masked sentences are infilled with the target style tokens in the “infill” stage. Despite their success, these approaches still suffer from the content preservation problem. By closely inspecting the results of existing approaches, we identify two common types of errors: 1) many content-related tokens are masked and 2) irrelevant words associated with the target style are infilled. Our paper aims to enhance content preservation by tackling each of them. In the “mask” stage, we utilize a BERT-based keyword extraction model that incorporates syntactic information to prevent content-related tokens from being masked. In the “infill” stage, we create a pseudo-parallel dataset and train a T5 model to infill the masked sentences without introducing irrelevant content. Empirical results show that our method outperforms the state-of-theart baselines in terms of content preservation, while maintaining comparable transfer effectiveness and language quality.",

    "abstract": "Image captioning is the process of automatically generating a textual description of an image. It has a wide range of applications, such as effective image search, auto archiving and even helping visually impaired people to see. English image captioning has seen a lot of development lately, while Arabic image captioning is lagging behind. In this work, we developed and evaluated several Arabic image captioning models with well-established metrics on a public image captioning benchmark. We initialized all models with transformers pre-trained on different Arabic corpora. After initialization, we fine-tuned them with image-caption pairs using a learning method called OSCAR. OSCAR uses object tags detected in images as anchor points to significantly ease the learning of image-text semantic alignments. In relation to the image captioning benchmark, our best performing model scored 0.39, 0.25, 0.15 and 0.092 with BLEU-1,2,3,4 respectively1 , an improvement over previously published scores of 0.33, 0.19, 0.11 and 0.057. Beside additional evaluation metrics, we complemented our scores with human evaluation on a sample of our output. Our experiments showed that training image captioning models with Arabic captions and English object tags is a working approach, but that a pure Arabic dataset, with Arabic object tags, would be preferable.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs) fail to generate long-form narrative text because they do not consider global structure. As a result, the generated texts are often incohesive, repetitive, or lack content. Recent work in story generation reintroduced explicit content planning in the form of prompts, keywords, or semantic frames. Trained on large parallel corpora, these models can generate more logical event sequences and thus more contentful stories. However, these intermediate representations are often not in natural language and cannot be utilized by PLMs without fine-tuning. We propose generating story plots using offthe-shelf PLMs while maintaining the benefit of content planning to generate cohesive and contentful stories. Our proposed method, SCRATCHPLOT, first prompts a PLM to compose a content plan. Then, we generate the story’s body and ending conditioned on the content plan. Furthermore, we take a generateand-rank approach by using additional PLMs to rank the generated (story, ending) pairs. We benchmark our method with various baselines and achieved superior results in both human and automatic evaluation.",

We test our model in the domain of bird descriptions. We show that group-level descriptions generated by our method are (i) coherent, pulling together properties that are true for all or majority of its instances, and (ii) informative, as they allow an external BERT-based text classifier to identify the target category more accurately in comparison to single-instance captions and are preferred by human evaluators.",

In the particular case of data to text applications, neural models are usually trained on large-scale datasets and sometimes generate text including divergences with respect to the input data. In this paper, we show the impact of the lack of domain knowledge in the generation of texts containing input-output divergences through a use case on meteorology. To analyze these phenomena we adapt a Transformer-based model to our specific domain, i.e., meteorology, and train it with a new dataset and corpus curated by meteorologists. Then, we perform a divergences’ detection step with a simple detector in order to identify the clearest divergences, especially those involving hallucinations. Finally, these hallucinations are analyzed by an expert in the meteorology domain, with the aim of classifying them by severity, taking into account the domain knowledge.",

However, recent approaches like “beam search and rerank” (BSR) incur significant computation overhead during inference, making realworld application infeasible. We aim to study if it is possible to build an amortized noisy channel NMT model such that when we do greedy decoding during inference, the translation accuracy matches that of BSR in terms of reward (based on the source-to-target log probability and the target-to-source log probability) and quality (based on BLEU and BLEURT). We attempt three approaches to train the new model: knowledge distillation, 1- step-deviation imitation learning, and Q learning. The first approach obtains the noisy channel signal from a pseudo-corpus, and the latter two approaches aim to optimize toward a noisy-channel MT reward directly. For all three approaches, the generated translations fail to achieve rewards comparable to BSR, but the translation quality approximated by BLEU and BLEURT is similar to the quality of BSRproduced translations. Additionally, all three approaches speed up inference by 1–2 orders of magnitude.",

    "session": "Demo/Poster Session 2",
    "abstract": "Auto regressive text generation for lowresource languages, particularly the option of using pre-trained language models, is a relatively under-explored problem. In this paper, we model Math Word Problem (MWP) generation as an auto-regressive text generation problem. We evaluate the pre-trained sequence-tosequence language models (mBART and mT5) in the context of two low-resource languages, Sinhala and Tamil, as well as English. For the evaluation, we create a multi-way parallel MWP dataset for the considered languages. Our empirical evaluation analyses how the performance of the pre-trained models is affected by the (1) amount of language data used during pre-training, (2) amount of data used in finetuning, (3) input seed length and (4) context differences in MWPs. Our results reveal that the considered pre-trained models are capable of generating meaningful MWPs even for the languages under-represented in these models, even though the amount of fine-tuning data and seed length are small. Our human evaluation shows that a Mathematics tutor can edit a generation question fairly easily, thus highlighting the practical utility ofautomatically generating MWPs.",

    "abstract": "Asking questions during a lecture is a central part of the traditional classroom setting which benefits both students and instructors in many ways. However, no previous work has studied the task of automatically generating student questions based on explicit lecture context. We study the feasibility of automatically generating student questions given the lecture transcript windows where the questions were asked. First, we create a data set of student questions and their corresponding lecture transcript windows. Using this data set, we investigate variants of T5, a sequence-to-sequence generative language model, for a preliminary exploration of this task. Specifically, we compare the effects of training with continuous prefix tuning and pre-training with search engine queries. Question generation evaluation results on two MOOCs show that that pre-training on search engine queries tends to make the generation model more precise whereas continuous prefix tuning offers mixed results.",

In this paper, we look specifically at captions of images across Arabic, Chinese, Farsi, German, Russian, and Turkish and describe a computational model for predicting lexical aspects. Despite the heterogeneity of these languages, and the salient invocation of distinctive linguistic resources across their caption corpora, speakers of these languages show surprising similarities in the ways they frame image content.

This paper tackles the problem of Chinese Nominal Metaphor (NM) generation. We introduce a novel multitask framework, which jointly optimizes three tasks: NM identification, NM component identification, and NM generation. The metaphor identification module is able to perform a self-training procedure, which discovers novel metaphors from a large-scale unlabeled corpus for NM generation. The NM component identification module emphasizes components during training and conditions the generation on these NM components for more coherent results. To train the NM identification and component identification modules, we construct an annotated corpus consisting of 6.3k sentences that contain diverse metaphorical patterns. Automatic metrics show that our method can produce diverse metaphors with good readability, where 92% of them are novel metaphorical comparisons. Human evaluation shows our model significantly outperforms baselines on consistency and creativity.",

In order to provide a conclusion generation model with gUIDance towards generating conclusions from a certain perspective, we explore the impact of conditioning the model on information about the desired framing. We experiment with conditioning generation via generic frame classes as well as with so-called issue-specific frames. Beyond conditioning the model on a desired frame, we investigate the impact of strategies to further improve the generated conclusion by i) an informative label smoothing method that dynamically smooths one-hot-encoded reference conclusion vectors as a regularization mechanism, and ii) a conclusion reranking strategy based on referenceless scores at inference time. We evaluate the benefits of our methods using metrics for automatic evaluation complemented with an extensive manual study. Our results show that frame-gUIDed conclusion generation is beneficial: it increases the ratio of valid and novel conclusions by 23%-points compared to a baseline without frame information. Our work indicates that i) by injecting frame information, conclusion generation can be directed towards desired aspects and ii) at the same time it can be manually confirmed to yield more valid and novel conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Multilingual language pretraining enables possibilities of transferring task knowledge learned from a rich-resource source language to the other, particularly favoring those low-resource languages with few or no task annotated data. However, knowledge about language and tasks encoded is strongly entangled in multilingual neural representations, thereby the learned task knowledge falsely correlated to the source language, falling short of cross-lingual transferability. In this paper, we present a novel language-agnostic finetuning (LAFT) to facilitate zero-resource cross-lingual transfer for text generation. LAFT performs language-agnostic task acquisition to isolate task learning completely from the source language, and then language specification for better generation for specified languages. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach facilitates a better and parameter-efficient transferability on two text generation tasks.",

We found that it is feasible to prompt InstructGPT to generate meaningful analogies and the best prompts tend to be precise imperative statements especially with low temperature setting. We also systematically analyzed the sensitivity of the InstructGPT model to prompt design and temperature and found that the model is particularly sensitive to certain variations (e.g., questions vs. imperative statements). Further, we conducted human evaluation on 1.3k of the generated analogies and found that the quality of generations varies substantially by model size. The largest InstructGPT model can achieve human-level performance at generating meaningful analogies for a given target while there is still room for improvement on the ACE task.",

They are usually designed and evaluated in open-ended text-only tasks, and it is not clear how different strategies handle the numerous challenges that goal-oriented multimodal systems face (such as grounding and informativeness). To answer this question, we compare a wide variety of different decoding strategies and hyper-parameter configurations in a Visual Dialogue referential game. Although none of them successfully balance lexical richness, accuracy in the task, and visual grounding, our in-depth analysis allows us to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each decoding strategy.

A new challenge we are introducing this year is to devise efficient metrics for evaluating the quality of minutes. We will also host an optional track to generate minutes for European parliamentary sessions. We carefully curated the datasets for the above tasks. Our ELITR Minuting Corpus has been recently accepted to LREC 2023 and publicly released.1 We are already preparing a new test set for evaluating the new shared tasks. We hope to carry forward the learning from the first AutoMin and instigate more community attention and interest in this timely yet challenging problem. INLG, the premier forum for the NLG community, would be an appropriate venue to discuss the challenges and future of Automatic Minuting. The main objective of the AutoMin GenChal at INLG 2023 would be to come up with efficient methods to automatically generate meeting minutes and design evaluation metrics to measure the quality of the minutes.",

Given the low-resource nature of Code-Mixing, machine generation of code-mixed text is a prevalent approach for data augmentation. However, evaluating the quality of such machine generated code-mixed text is an open problem. In our submission to HinglishEval, a sharedtask collocated with INLG2023, we attempt to build models factors that impact the quality of synthetically generated code-mix text by predicting ratings for code-mix quality. HinglishEval Shared Task consists of two sub-tasks - a) Quality rating prediction); b) Disagreement prediction. We leverage popular codemixed metrics and embeddings of multilingual large language models (MLLMs) as features, and train task specific MLP regression models. Our approach could not beat the baseline results. However, for Subtask-A our team ranked a close second on F-1 and Cohen’s Kappa Score measures and first for Mean Squared Error measure. For Subtask-B our approach ranked third for F1 score, and first for Mean Squared Error measure.",

The challenge was to design a system that can generate fluent and salient summaries of a multi-turn dialogue text. Dialogue summarization has many commercial applications as it can be used to summarize conversations between customers and service agents, meeting notes, conference proceedings etc. Appropriate dialogue summarization can enhance the experience of conversing with chatbots or personal digital assistants. We have proposed a topic-based abstractive summarization method, which is generated by fine-tuning PEGASUS1 , which is the state of the art abstractive summary generation model.We have compared different types of fine-tuning approaches that can lead to different types of summaries. We found that since conversations usually veer around a topic, using topics along with the dialoagues, helps to generate more human-like summaries. The topics in this case resemble user perspective, around which summaries are usually sought. The generated summary has been evaluated with ground truth summaries provided by the challenge owners. We use the py-rouge score and BERT-Score metrics to compare the results.",
